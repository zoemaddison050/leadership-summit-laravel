- **Key Areas Tested**:
  - Full card payment registration flow
  - Payment method switching
  - Payment failure and retry scenarios
  - Amount limit validation
  - Expired registration data handling
  - Webhook notification processing
  - Payment availability checking

#### `tests/Feature/AdminPaymentManagementTest.php`

- **Purpose**: Tests admin interface for payment management
- **Coverage**: 12 test methods for admin functionality
- **Key Areas Tested**:
  - UniPayment configuration management
  - Connection testing from admin panel
  - Payment transaction viewing and filtering
  - Transaction export functionality
  - Manual payment verification
  - Payment refund processing
  - Payment statistics generation
  - Access control and permissions

#### `tests/Feature/PaymentErrorRecoveryTest.php`

- **Purpose**: Tests error handling and recovery scenarios
- **Coverage**: 10 test methods for error scenarios
- **Key Areas Tested**:
  - API connection timeouts
  - Invalid API credentials
  - Network interruptions
  - Webhook processing failures
  - Duplicate webhook handling
  - Session corruption recovery
  - Malformed data handling
  - Concurrent payment attempts

## Test Coverage Summary

### Requirements Coverage

The testing suite addresses all requirements from the specification:

**Requirement 1.1** - Card payment registration flow

- ✅ Full integration tests for complete payment flow
- ✅ Session management and data validation
- ✅ Error recovery and retry mechanisms

**Requirement 1.2** - Payment processing and verification

- ✅ Unit tests for payment creation and verification
- ✅ Webhook signature verification tests
- ✅ Payment status validation tests

**Requirement 1.3** - Security measures

- ✅ Comprehensive webhook security tests
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization tests
- ✅ Authentication and authorization tests

**Requirement 8.3** - Error handling

- ✅ Extensive error recovery scenario tests
- ✅ Network failure handling tests
- ✅ Invalid data handling tests

**Requirement 9.1** - Admin management features

- ✅ Admin configuration interface tests
- ✅ Transaction management tests
- ✅ Payment verification and refund tests

**Requirement 5.1** - Payment method switching

- ✅ Method switching integration tests
- ✅ Amount limit validation tests
- ✅ Session preservation tests

### Security Testing

The security testing covers:

- **Webhook Security**: Signature verification, replay attack prevention, timing attack resistance
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, data sanitization
- **Authentication**: Admin access control, API credential validation
- **Session Security**: Session timeout handling, data encryption, secure storage

### Error Recovery Testing

The error recovery testing covers:

- **Network Issues**: Connection timeouts, network interruptions, API unavailability
- **Data Issues**: Malformed payloads, missing data, corrupted sessions
- **Business Logic**: Duplicate payments, expired sessions, invalid amounts
- **System Issues**: Database failures, service unavailability, concurrent access

## Test Quality Features

### Mocking and Isolation

- Proper mocking of external dependencies (UniPayment SDK)
- Isolated unit tests that don't depend on external services
- Database transactions for clean test state

### Comprehensive Assertions

- Detailed assertions for all expected outcomes
- Error message validation
- Database state verification
- Session state validation

### Edge Case Coverage

- Boundary value testing for amounts and limits
- Invalid input handling
- Concurrent access scenarios
- System failure scenarios

### Logging and Monitoring

- Tests verify proper logging of security events
- Error logging validation
- Audit trail verification

## Running the Tests

The tests are designed to be run with PHPUnit and include:

```bash
# Run all payment-related tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Services/UniPaymentServiceTest.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Security/WebhookSecurityTest.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Requests/CardPaymentRequestTest.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/PaymentFlowIntegrationTest.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AdminPaymentManagementTest.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/PaymentErrorRecoveryTest.php

# Or run all tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Test Environment Requirements

The tests require:

- Laravel testing environment with SQLite in-memory database
- Mockery for mocking external dependencies
- Proper environment configuration for testing
- Spatie Laravel Permission package for role-based testing

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing suite ensures the card payment integration is robust, secure, and reliable. It covers all functional requirements, security concerns, and error scenarios, providing confidence in the payment system's stability and correctness.

The tests follow Laravel testing best practices and provide excellent coverage of both happy path and edge case scenarios, making the payment system production-ready and maintainable.
