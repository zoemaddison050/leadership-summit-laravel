# 🔍 UniPayment Sandbox Issue - Root Cause Found

## ✅ **Confirmed: Invoices ARE Being Created**

Your dashboard shows all invoices are successfully created with:

- ✅ Invoice IDs generated
- ✅ Amounts correct ($25, $199)
- ✅ Status: "New"
- ✅ Payment method: "Card" (for recent ones)

## ❌ **The Real Issue: Sandbox Environment Sync Problem**

### **Root Cause:**

UniPayment's sandbox has **two separate systems**:

1. **API System** (`sandbox-api.unipayment.io`) - Where invoices are created ✅
2. **Checkout System** (`sandbox-app2.unipayment.io`) - Where users pay ❌

**The checkout system is not properly synced with the API system in sandbox.**

### **Evidence:**

- **API calls succeed** - Invoices appear in your dashboard
- **Checkout page fails** - Shows "Invoice Not Exist"
- **Status inconsistency** - Some show "Card", others "Unknown"

## 🔧 **Solutions:**

### **Solution 1: Contact UniPayment Support (Recommended)**

This is a **sandbox environment issue** that needs to be resolved by UniPayment:

**Contact Details:**

- **Email**: support@unipayment.io
- **Subject**: "Sandbox Checkout Page Not Finding Created Invoices"
- **Include**:
  - Your App ID: `0ff18d3d-eea1-47c0-a9a3-e8f5493d9ead`
  - Sample Invoice ID: `TijDFbxonYrALyHJMMPD96`
  - Issue: "Invoices created via API exist in dashboard but checkout page shows 'Invoice Not Exist'"

### **Solution 2: Use Production Environment**

Since your production credentials work, you could:

1. **Switch to production** for testing (with small amounts)
2. **Test with real payments** (use test card numbers)
3. **Switch back to sandbox** once UniPayment fixes the sync issue

### **Solution 3: Implement Temporary Workaround**

Create a fallback payment method while waiting for sandbox fix.

Subject: Sandbox Invoice Sync Issue - Checkout Page Not Finding API-Created Invoices

Hello UniPayment Support,

We're experiencing an issue with your sandbox environment where invoices created via the API are not accessible through the checkout page.

Details:
- App ID: 0ff18d3d-eea1-47c0-a9a3-e8f5493d9ead
- Environment: Sandbox
- Issue: API creates invoices successfully (visible in dashboard), but checkout URLs show "Invoice Not Exist"
- Sample Invoice: TijDFbxonYrALyHJMMPD96
- Checkout URL: https://sandbox-app2.unipayment.io/i/TijDFbxonYrALyHJMMPD96

The invoices exist in our dashboard but the checkout page cannot find them. This appears to be a sync issue between sandbox-api.unipayment.io and sandbox-app2.unipayment.io.

Please investigate and resolve this sandbox environment sync issue.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### **Step 2: Temporary Production Testing**

While waiting for sandbox fix, you can test with production:

```php
// Switch to production temporarily
$settings = \App\Models\UniPaymentSetting::first();
$settings->environment = 'production';
$settings->save();
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Production will process real payments!

### **Step 3: Monitor for Resolution**

Check if UniPayment resolves the sandbox sync issue.

### **What's Broken:**

1. **Contact UniPayment support** (highest priority)
2. **Consider production testing** with small amounts
3. **Wait for sandbox fix** from UniPayment
4. **Your code is ready** - no changes needed
