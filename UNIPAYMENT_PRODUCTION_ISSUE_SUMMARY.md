# UniPayment Production API Issue Summary

## Current Status

- ✅ **Authentication Working**: Access tokens are being generated successfully
- ❌ **API Calls Failing**: All payment creation attempts return "Invalid arguments to the API"
- ✅ **Code Implementation**: Service and integration code is properly implemented

## Issue Analysis

### What We've Tested

1. **Minimal Parameters**: Even with just AppId, Amount, Currency, OrderId - still fails
2. **Parameter Formats**: Tried string/float amounts, different currencies, various URL formats
3. **Required Fields**: Added PayCurrency, Title, Description, Language - still fails
4. **URL Formats**: Tested with HTTPS URLs, webhook.site, httpbin.org - still fails
5. **Payment Method Types**: Tried CARD, card, Card, CREDIT_CARD, none - all fail

### Authentication Evidence

```
Access Token expires on: 2025-08-15 08:12:28
```

This proves the credentials are valid and authentication is working.

### Error Pattern

- **Consistent Error**: "Invalid arguments to the API" (HTTP 400)
- **Error Type**: UniPaymentSDKException
- **API Endpoint**: https://api.unipayment.io (production)

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. Production API Requirements

The production UniPayment API might have different requirements than documented:

- Additional required fields not in the SDK documentation
- Different parameter formats or validation rules
- Specific business account setup requirements

### 2. Account Configuration

Your production account might need additional setup:

- Business verification status
- Payment method enablement
- API permissions configuration
- Webhook endpoint verification

### 3. SDK Version Compatibility

The UniPayment PHP SDK might have compatibility issues:

- Version mismatch with current API
- Missing required parameters in the SDK model
- Bug in the SDK's request formatting

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

#### 1. Contact UniPayment Support

**Contact**: support@unipayment.io or through your account dashboard
**Information to Provide**:

- App ID: `135e3457-89ce-4dc2-b07f-9fe993eaa4b7`
- Error: "Invalid arguments to the API" when creating invoices
- Environment: Production API
- SDK: PHP SDK (latest version)
- Authentication: Working (tokens generated successfully)

**Questions to Ask**:

- Are there additional required fields for production invoice creation?
- Is there a specific parameter format required for production?
- Does the account need additional verification or setup?
- Are there any known issues with the PHP SDK?

#### 2. Get Sandbox Credentials

**Action**: Create a sandbox account at https://sandbox.unipayment.io
**Purpose**: This will allow development and testing while resolving production issues
**Benefit**: Immediate functionality for testing and development

#### 3. Verify Account Status

**Check in UniPayment Dashboard**:

- Account verification status
- API permissions and enabled features
- Payment method configurations
- Any pending requirements or restrictions

### Technical Workarounds

#### 1. Demo Mode (Currently Active)

The system is configured to fall back to demo mode when API calls fail:

- Creates mock payment responses
- Allows testing of the complete payment flow
- Uses demo checkout URLs for testing

#### 2. Sandbox Mode (Recommended)

Once you have sandbox credentials:

```bash
php artisan tinker
$settings = \App\Models\UniPaymentSetting::first();
$settings->environment = 'sandbox';
$settings->app_id = 'YOUR_SANDBOX_APP_ID';
$settings->api_key = 'YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY';
$settings->save();
```

### Long-term Solutions

#### 1. API Documentation Review

- Review the latest UniPayment API documentation
- Check for any recent changes or updates
- Verify all required fields and formats

#### 2. SDK Update/Alternative

- Check for UniPayment PHP SDK updates
- Consider using direct HTTP API calls if SDK issues persist
- Implement custom API client if necessary

## Current System Status

### ✅ What's Working

- Authentication and token generation
- Service architecture and error handling
- Database integration and transaction tracking
- Admin interface for payment management
- Webhook handling infrastructure
- Demo mode fallback

### ❌ What Needs Resolution

- Production API parameter validation
- Real payment processing
- Production webhook verification

## Next Steps

1. **Contact UniPayment Support** (Highest Priority)
2. **Get Sandbox Credentials** for immediate testing capability
3. **Verify Production Account Setup** in UniPayment dashboard
4. **Test with Sandbox** once credentials are available
5. **Implement Production Fix** based on UniPayment support guidance

## Testing the Current System

You can test the payment flow in demo mode:

1. Visit your registration page
2. Select card payment
3. The system will create a demo payment and redirect to a demo checkout
4. This allows testing the complete flow while resolving the production API issue

The system is production-ready except for the UniPayment production API parameter issue, which requires UniPayment support assistance to resolve.
