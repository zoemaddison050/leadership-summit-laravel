# Leadership Summit Laravel Application

This repository contains the Laravel application for the Leadership Summit event management system, rebuilt from a WordPress site for improved performance, security, and maintainability.

## Summary

Leadership Summit is a production-ready Laravel application that centralizes event management: event creation, speaker profiles, session scheduling, ticket sales and registration, payment processing, CMS pages, and media handling. The project uses Docker for reproducible development environments and includes scripts for deployment to staging and production.

## Core idea

Provide an all-in-one platform for event organizers to run conferences and summits with role-based access, secure payment processing, webhook and gateway integrations, and performance optimizations (caching, asset/image optimization, and query tuning). The app focuses on reliability, security, and maintainability while simplifying content and attendee management for admins and organizers.

If you want additional sections (deployment steps, troubleshooting, or developer commands) I can restore or generate them separately on request.
