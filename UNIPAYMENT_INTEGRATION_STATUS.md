# UniPayment Integration Status

## ✅ What's Working:

- **Laravel Service**: `UniPaymentOfficialService` is properly implemented
- **API Format**: Following official UniPayment documentation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Authentication Flow**: Token generation logic is correct
- **Payment Creation**: Payment creation logic is correct

## ❌ Current Issue:

**Missing Correct Client Secret**

- **App ID**: `0ff18d3d-eea1-47c0-a9a3-e8f5493d9ead` ✅ (Correct)
- **Client Secret**: `9JFg5ZZSbry8yx6y54DHKWKRZhRZirAep` ❌ (For old Client ID)

## 🔧 What We Need:

**The Client Secret (API Key) that corresponds to App ID `0ff18d3d-eea1-47c0-a9a3-e8f5493d9ead`**

You can find this in your UniPayment sandbox dashboard:

1. Login to https://sandbox.unipayment.io
2. Go to your app with ID `0ff18d3d-eea1-47c0-a9a3-e8f5493d9ead`
3. Copy the **Client Secret** or **API Key**

## 🚀 Once We Have the Correct Client Secret:

1. Update the database with the correct credentials
2. Test the integration (should work immediately)
3. Update PaymentController to use the new service
4. Test the full payment flow

## 📋 Integration Components Ready:

- ✅ `UniPaymentOfficialService` - Main service class
- ✅ Database configuration system
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Test methods
- ✅ Payment creation logic
- ✅ Payment status checking
- ✅ Webhook handling (existing)

## 🎯 Expected Result:

Once we have the correct Client Secret, the integration should work immediately and you'll be able to:

- Create payments through Laravel
- Get checkout URLs
- Process card payments
- Handle webhooks
- Track payment status

**We're 99% complete - just need the matching Client Secret!**
