# ✅ Website Structure Fixed

## Problem Resolved

The website was showing Laravel's default authentication routes (login/register) to regular users, which was confusing the purpose of the site.

## Solution Implemented

### 🌐 **Public Website (Client-Facing)**

- **Homepage**: Clean leadership summit website
- **Register Now Buttons**:
  - ✅ Header: Links to event registration
  - ✅ Hero section: Links to event registration
  - ✅ Footer: Links to event registration
- **Navigation**: No login/register links for regular users
- **Purpose**: Event registration and information only

### 🔐 **Admin Panel (Admin-Only)**

- **Admin Login**: `http://localhost:8000/login`
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:8000/admin` (after login)
- **Purpose**: Manage events, speakers, payments, etc.
- **Access**: Admin credentials only

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Public User Registration**

```php
// Before: Auth::routes(); (enabled public registration)
// After: Only admin login routes
Route::get('login', [App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController::class, 'showLoginForm'])->name('login');
Route::post('login', [App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController::class, 'login']);
Route::post('logout', [App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController::class, 'logout'])->name('logout');
```

### 2. **Updated Login Page for Admin Use**

- Changed title from "Welcome Back" to "Admin Login"
- Removed "Create Account" button
- Added "Back to Website" button
- Clear indication this is admin-only access

### 3. **Clean Public Navigation**

- No login/register links in main navigation
- Only "Register Now" buttons for event registration
- Admin links only visible to logged-in admins

## Current Website Flow

### 👥 **Regular Visitors**

1. Visit homepage: `http://localhost:8000`
2. See "Register Now" buttons everywhere
3. Click "Register Now" → Event registration form
4. Complete event registration with payment
5. No user account creation needed

### 🔧 **Administrators**

1. Go to admin login: `http://localhost:8000/login`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Access admin panel: `http://localhost:8000/admin`
4. Manage events, speakers, payments, etc.

## Routes Summary
