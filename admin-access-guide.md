# Admin Panel Access Guide

## How to Access Your Admin Panel

### 1. Admin Login Steps

**IMPORTANT**: Admin login is separate from the public website!

   - **Password**: `password`
3. **After successful login, access admin panel**: `http://localhost:8000/admin`

**Note**:

- The login page is for **admin access only** - no public user registration
- Regular visitors use the "Register Now" buttons for **event registration**

### 7. Troubleshooting Admin Access

If you can't access the admin panel:

```bash
# Check if admin user exists
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker --execute="User::where('email', 'admin@leadershipsummit.com')->first()"

# Create admin user manually
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker --execute="
\$adminRole = App\Models\Role::where('name', 'admin')->first();
\$user = App\Models\User::create([
    'name' => 'Admin User',
    'email' => 'admin@leadershipsummit.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('password')
]);
\$user->roles()->attach(\$adminRole);
echo 'Admin user created successfully';
"
