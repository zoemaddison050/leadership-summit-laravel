# UniPayment Error Handling Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to improve error handling and fallback mechanisms for the UniPayment integration when API credentials are invalid or API calls fail. The current implementation fails with cryptic errors when UniPayment credentials are invalid, providing a poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Graceful API Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user attempting to make a payment, I want the system to handle UniPayment API errors gracefully so that I can still complete my payment through alternative means.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UniPayment API returns "invalid_client" error THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to demo mode
2. WHEN UniPayment API returns any 400-level authentication error THEN the system SHALL log the error and use demo payment flow
3. WHEN UniPayment SDK throws an exception due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL catch the exception and provide a fallback
4. WHEN falling back to demo mode THEN the system SHALL log a warning message indicating the fallback occurred
5. WHEN in demo mode THEN the system SHALL create a mock payment that redirects to a demo checkout page

### Requirement 2: Improved Demo Mode Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect when to use demo mode so that development and testing can proceed smoothly even with invalid credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials contain "test" or "demo" keywords THEN the system SHALL use demo mode
2. WHEN running in local environment AND credentials appear invalid THEN the system SHALL use demo mode
3. WHEN credentials fail basic format validation THEN the system SHALL use demo mode
4. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to demo mode
5. WHEN in demo mode THEN all payment operations SHALL use mock responses

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error logs when UniPayment integration fails so that I can diagnose and fix credential or configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UniPayment API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the full error message and response
2. WHEN falling back to demo mode THEN the system SHALL log the reason for the fallback
3. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL log credential validation details (without exposing sensitive data)
4. WHEN SDK exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL log the full stack trace
5. WHEN in demo mode THEN the system SHALL log that demo mode is active

### Requirement 4: User-Friendly Error Messages

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when payment processing fails so that I understand what happened and what my options are.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment processing fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN falling back to demo mode THEN the user SHALL be informed they are using a demo payment system
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the user SHALL see a generic "payment processing error" message
4. WHEN demo mode is active THEN the checkout page SHALL clearly indicate it's a demo/test environment
5. WHEN payment fails THEN the user SHALL be offered alternative payment methods

### Requirement 5: Demo Payment Flow

**User Story:** As a user in demo mode, I want a realistic payment experience that simulates the actual payment flow so that I can test the complete registration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a demo payment THEN the system SHALL generate a unique demo invoice ID
2. WHEN redirecting to demo checkout THEN the URL SHALL include payment details as parameters
3. WHEN demo checkout page loads THEN it SHALL display payment amount and details
4. WHEN user completes demo payment THEN the system SHALL simulate successful payment callback
5. WHEN demo payment is processed THEN the registration SHALL be marked as paid and completed
