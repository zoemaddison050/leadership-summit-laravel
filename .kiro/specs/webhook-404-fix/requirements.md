# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UniPayment integration is experiencing 404 errors when sending webhook notifications. The current implementation uses a hardcoded webhook.site URL that doesn't properly route to the Laravel application's webhook handler, causing payment processing failures and preventing users from completing their registrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want webhook notifications to be properly received and processed, so that payment confirmations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UniPayment sends a webhook notification THEN the system SHALL receive it at the correct endpoint without 404 errors
2. WHEN a webhook is received THEN the system SHALL properly authenticate and process the notification
3. WHEN webhook processing completes THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes to UniPayment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user making a payment, I want my payment to be confirmed automatically, so that I receive immediate confirmation of my registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card payment is completed THEN the webhook SHALL trigger automatic registration confirmation
2. WHEN webhook processing succeeds THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation email within 5 minutes
3. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide fallback processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper webhook URL configuration for different environments, so that the system works in both development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use ngrok or similar tunneling for webhook access
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use the production domain for webhook URLs
3. WHEN webhook URLs are generated THEN they SHALL be properly formatted and accessible
4. IF the environment cannot support webhooks THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want webhook security and validation, so that only legitimate notifications are processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a webhook is received THEN the system SHALL validate the signature if provided
2. WHEN signature validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the webhook with 401 status
3. WHEN webhook payload is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject with 400 status
4. WHEN webhook processing succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 200 status
